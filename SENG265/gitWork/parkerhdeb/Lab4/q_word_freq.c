int word_freq(char *sentence, char *word);

/*
 * This program will take a word from the command line.
 * An example of sequence of terminal commands to run the program is:

        gcc word_freq.c -o word_freq
        ./word_freq match

 * Properly implemented, the running the above commands will
 * produce the following output to console:

        The word "match" appears 4 times

 * NOTE: To keep things simple, we are keeping case in place.
 * That is to say that "match" and "Match" are considered as different
 * in counting.
