Why?
- built in data types
    - strings, lists, and more
- matrix operations
- simpler syntax
- good for machine learning

eg:

if z == 3.45 or y == "Hello":
    x = x+1     #Addition
    y = y + " World!"   # String concatenation
    w = x // 4      # Integer Division
    z = x / 4       # Floating point division

print(x)
print(format(y, ".2f")) # Two digits after decimal

For numbers:
- + - * %
For strings
+ % (for formatting)
Logic
- and or not
Variables
- first assignment creates it
- uses indentation

Basic Datatypes
- Integers
    z = 5//2 # Answer is 2, integer division
- Floats
    x = 3.456
    y = 4/3     # Answer is 1.33, floating point division
- Strings
    "abc" or 'abc'
    - unmatched quotations occur within the string
        - "matt's"
    - use triple double-quotes for multi-line strings or strings that contain both ' and " inside them:
    """a'b"c"""

Whitespace
- \ new line
- no {} - consistent indentation instead
- Often a colon appears at the start of a new block
- Tip: configure editor to use spaces for indents (no tabs)
            - no!

Comments
- #
- (This is a bit like "//" in Java and C++)
- tripple quotes for multi line:
    """This is the docstring. This here function
    does something truly wonderful, or so
    we think despite seeing no code at all."""

Assignment
- Binding a variable means setting a name to hold a reference to some object
- Names in Python do not have intrinsic type
    - Objects have types
- reference is deleted after any names have passed out of scope

Multiple Assignment
>>> x, y = 2, 3
>>> x
2
>>> y
3

Nameing Rules
- names are case sensitive and cannot start with a number
- there are reserved words (obvious ones)

Sequence Types: Tuples, Strings, and Lists

Sequence Types: Tuple
- Simple immutable ordered sequence of items 
- items can be mixed types, including collection types
        >>> tu = (23, 'abc', 4.56, (2,3), 'def')

Strings
- Immutable
- Conceptually very much like a tuple
        >>> st = "Hello World"
List
- Mutable ordered sequence of items or mixed types
        >>> li = ["abc", 34, 4.34, 23]
Similar Syntax
- All three types share much the same syntax and funtionality
- Key difference:
    - Tuples and strings are immutable (cannot be modified)
    - Lists are mutable (can be modified)
    - opperations are the same for all of them

Sequence Types continued:
- we can index tuples, lists, and strings
>>> tu[1]
'abc'
>>> li[1]
34
>>> st[1]
'e'

Positive and negative indices
- 0 starts at the left
- -1 starts from the right

Slicing: Return copy of a Tuple 
>>> t[1:4] #inclusive
>>> t[1:-1]
>>> t[:2]
>>> t[2:]
>>> li[:] #copy of entire sequence

The 'in' Operator - Boolean test
>>> t = [1,2,4,5]
>>> 3 in t
False
- for strings, tests substrings
>>> s = 'abcde'
>>> 'c' in s
True
>>> 'cd' in s
True
>>> 'ac' in s
False
- in is also used for loops and comprehensions

The + Operator
- produces a new tuple, list , or string with concatenation of arrguments

The * Operator
- Produces a new tuple, list, or string that "repeats" the original content

Mutability: Typles vs. Lists
- Tuples: Immutable
>>> t = (23, 'abc', 4.56, (2,3), 'def')
>>> t(2) = 3.14
Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<pyshell#75>, line 1, in -toplevel-
        tu[2] = 3.14
    TypeError: object doesn't support item assignment

- You cannot change a tuple!
- However, you can make a fresh tuple and assign its reference to previous name

- Lists: Mutable
>>> li = ['abc', 23, 4.34, 23]
>>> li[1] = 45
>>> li
['abc', 45, 4.34, 23]
- We can change lists in place
- name still points to original list

Operations on Lists Only
>>> li = [1,11,3,4,5]
>>> li.append('a') #using method syntax
>>> li
[1,11,3,4,5,'a']

>>> li.insert(2,'i')
>>>li.insert(2,'i')
>>>li
[1,11,'i',3,4,5,'a']

The .extend method vs + operator
- + creates a fresh list (with new memory reference)
- .extend operates on a li in place
>>> li.extend([9,8,7])
>>>li
[1,2'i',3,4,5,'a',9,8,7]

- Confusing
    -  extend takes a list as an argument
    - append takes a singleton as an argument 
>>> li.append([10,11,12])
>>> li
[1,2,'i',3,4,5,'a',9,8,7,[10,11,12]]

- extend != append

Operations on Lists Only
>>> li.index('b') #index of first occurrence
>>> li.count('b') #number of occurrences
>>> li.remove('b') #remove first occurrence
>>> li.reverse()    #reverse list in place
>>> li.sort()       #sort the list in place
>>> li.sort(some_funciton) #sort in place using user-defined comparison

Tuples vs. Lists
- Lists are slower at runtime, but more flexible than tuples
- to convert between tuples and lists use the list() and tuple() functions
    - li = list(tu)
    - tu = tuple(li)

Understanding Refernce Semantics in Python
- x = y — not a copy of y!
- x = y - is a reference to the object y
- x = 3 - "x now refers to the integer 3"

Assignment 
- incrementing creates a new memory location with value, redirects the pointer, then garbage collects the old location

Dicitonaries: A Mapping Type
- stores a mapping between sets of keys and a set of values
    - keys can be immutable
    - values can be any type
    - a single dictionary can store values of different types
- You can define, modify, view, lookup, and delete the key-value pairs in the dictionary
>>> d = {'user':'bozo', 'pswd':1234}
>>> d['user']
'bozo'
>>> d['pswd']
1234
>>> d['bozo']
KeyError: bozo

Updating Dictionaries
>>> d['user'] = 'clown'

Removing dictionary entries
>>> d = {'user':'bozo', 'p':1234, 'i'34}
>>> del d['user']
>>> d
{'p':1234, 'i':34}

>>> d.clear()
>>> d
{}

Useful Accessor Methods
>>> d.keys()        #list of keys
>>> list(d.keys())  #actual list
>>> d.values()      #list of values
>>> d.items()       #list of item tuples

Funcations in Python
>>> def det_final_answer(filename):
    """Documentation"""
    total_counter = 0
    line1
    line2
    return total_counter

Reminder: Python and Types
- determines types automatically
- enforces the types of objects
    - ex: must convert an integer to a string before appending it to a string

Calling a Function
>>> def myfun(x,y):
        return x*y
>>> my fun(3,4)
12

Parameters are "call by assignment"
- acts like call by reference and sometimes like call by value in C++

Functions without returns
- all functions have a return value even if no return line inside code
- functions without a return return None
    - None is a special constant 
    - None is used like NULL, void, or nil
    - None is logically equivalent to False
    - Interpreter doesn't print None

Function overloading? No
- two different functions can't have the same name

Functions are first-class objects in Python
- can be used as any other data type
    - can be an argument to a function
    - assigned to a variable
    - part of a tuple, list, or any other container

Default Values for Arguments
- can provide default, optional, values 
>>> def myfun(b, c=3, d="hello"):
        return b+c
>>> myfun(5,3,"hello")
>>> myfun(5,3)
>>> myfun(5)

The Order of Arguements
- can call a function with some or all of its arguments out of order as long as you specify them
>>> def myfun(a,b,c):
        return a-b
>>> myfun(2,1,43)
1
>>> myfun(c=43, b1, a=2)
1
>>> myfun(2,c=43,b=1)
1

A detour: command-line args
- import sys # gives command line arguments
>>> def main():
    if len(sys.argv) == 1:
        print ("No arguments")
    else:
        print ("First argument is", sys.argv[1])
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

import argparse
def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--width', type=int, default=75, help='length of line')
    parser.add_argument('--indent',type=int , default=0,
        help='number of blank characters to use at start of line')
    parser.add_argument('--number', type=int, default=10,
        help="add line numbering")
    parser.add_argument('filename', nargs='?', help='file to be processed')

    args = parser.parse_args()

    print ('width: {}; indent: {}; number: {}'.format( args.width,
        args.indent, args.number))
    if args.filename:
        print ('filename: ', args.filename)
    else:
        print ('no filename specified')
if __name__ == "__main__":
main()

Another detour: "main" function

#!/usr/bin/env python # Must be where Python is located...
def main():
    print ("Here we are in main. About to visit caveOfCaerbannog.")
    caveOfCaerbannog()
    print()
    print ("Now we're back in main. About to call camelot().")
    camelot()
    print()
    print ("I feel happy! I feel hap...")
def caveOfCaerbannog():
    print ("We are visiting the dreadful Cave of Caerbannog.")
    print ("Heck, there are cute rabbits here like at UVic.")
    print ("Come here little raaaaa... AUGH!")
def camelot():
    print ("Here we are in Camelot.")
    print ("Let's leave. It is a silly place.")
if __name__ == "__main__":
main()

Logical Expressions: True and False
- equivalents:
    - False: sero, None, empty container or object
    - True: non-zero numbers, non-empty objects
- Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, <=, etc
    - X and Y have same value: X == Y
    - Compare with X is Y:
        X and Y are two variables that refer to the same identical object

Boolean Logic Expressions
- and
- or
- not
- use parentheses as needed

Special Properties of and *and* or
- uses short circuit evaluation

Contiditional Expressions
- x = (true_value if condition else false value)

If, while, assert

Break and continue
- break leaves the loop entirely
- continue skips current iteration

assert
- checks to make sure something is true
- if false, the program stops
        assert(number_of_players < 5)

For Loops / List Comprehensions
- for <item> in <collection>:
    <statements>
- if <collection> is a string, it will loop through each character
- <item> can also be a collection if <collection> has nested collections
    - for (x,y) in [("a",1), ("b",2), ("c",3), ("d",4)]:
        print (x)

For loops and the range() function
- range() returns a list of numbers from 0 to n-1
- enumerate() returns a sequence of integer, item pairs


List Comprehensions
- generates a new list by applying funtion to every member of original list
>>> li = [3,6,2,7]
>>> [elem*2 for elem in li]
[6,12,4,14]

- in general, [expression for name in list]
- if elements are containers, then name can consist of container names
>>> li = [('a',1), ('b',2) ('c',7)]
>>> [n*3 for (x,n) in li]
[3,6,21]

- can also use expressions: [subtract(y,x) for (x,y) in oplist]

Filtered list comprehensions
- [expression for name in list if filter]
>>> li = [3,6,2,7,1,9]
>>> [elem*2 for elem in li if elem >4]
[12,14,18]

Nested list comprehensions
- since expressions take a list as input and produce a list as output...
>>> li = [3,2,4,1]
>>> [elem*2 for elem in
        [item+1 for item in li]]
[8,6,10,4]

FANCY FUNCTION SYNTAX

Lambda Notation
- functions can be defined without giving them names
- only works for single-parameter, single-expression functions
>>> def applier(q,x):
    return q(x)
>>> applier(lambda z: z*4,7)
28

String to list to string
<separator_string>.join(<some_list>)
>>> ":".join(["abc","def","ghi"])
"abc:def:ghi"

<some_string>.split(<separator_string>)
>>> "abd:def:ghi".split(":")
["abc","def",ghi"]

Conver anything to a string
- str()

String Operations
- "hello".upper()
'HELLO'

String Formatting Operator: %
- basically, fill in the blanks
>>> x="abc"
>>>y=34
>>>"%s xyz %d" % (x,y)
'abc xyz 34'

Printing with Python
- print()
- use % to format output text
>>> print("%s xyz %d" % ("abc", 34) )
abc xyz 34

More complex formatting
>>> print('Course unit: {}; Number {}'.format('SENG','265'))
Course unit: SENG; Number 265
>>> print('Course unit: {1}; Number {0}'.format('SENG','265'))
Course unit: 265; Number SENG
- controlling size of numeric fields:
>>> import math
>>> print('Value of e is about {0:.3f}'.format(math.e))
Value of e is about 2.718

Wordcout for stdin:

File processing and error handling (practice)
import sys
fileptr = open('filename','r')
if fileptr == None:
    print("Something bad happened")
    sys.exit(1)
somestring = fileptr.read() # read one line
for line in fileptr:        # continue reading
    print (line)
fileptr.close()

WORKING WITH FILES
- can specify read or write when opening and as strings or byte arrays
file = open("somefile", "r") # or "rb", "w", "wb"

Working with files
>>> file = open("fubar", "w")
>>> file.write("hamberders\n")
11
>>> file.close()

Writing specific ASCII values
- supports ASCII and UTF-8

Working with binary
- sometimes we need binary representation instead of integer value
>>> import struct
>>> bytes = struct.pack("I", 121) # 121 as a four-byte int
>>> chars = [chr(c) for c in bytes] # each byte as a ASCII
>>> s = "".join(chars)
>>> s
'y\x00\x00\x00'
>>> somefile.write(s)

pg 115

Exeption Handling
- errors are a kind of object in python
- try, except, finally, catch
while True:
    try:
        x = int(input("Number, please! "))
        print ("The number was: ", x)
        break
    except ValueError:
        print ("Oops! That was not a valid number.")
        print ("Try again.")
        print ()

Exceptions and handlers
try:
    f = open("gift.txt", "r")
    # do file-open things here
    f.close()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Cannot open gift.txt")
    # do file-doesn't-exist stuff here
except PermissionError:
    print("Whatcha trying to do here with gift.txt, eh?")
    # do failure-due-to-permissions stuff here

More examples:
def loud_kaboom():
    x = 1/0;
def fireworks_factory():
    raise ZeroDivisionError("Gasoline near bone-dry Christmas trees!")
def playing_with_fire():
    try:
        loud_kaboom()
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        print ("Handling run-time error: ", exc)
    try:
        fireworks_factory()
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print ("Gotta stop this from happening...")

SCOPING order:
- Location definition
    - Enclosing definition
        - global definition
            - built-in defintion

ASSIGNMENT and CONTAINERS
Multiple Assignment with sequences
>>> (x, y, (w, z)) = (2, 3, (4, 5))
>>> [x, y] = [4, 5]

Empty Containers 1
>>> li = []
>>> tu = ()
>>> di = {}

Importing and Modules examples:
>>> import somefile
>>> from somefile import *
>>> from somefile import className
- * gets everything

Common modules
- sys, os, os.path, math, Random


Creating and saving your own modules
- looks in sys.path
- to add a directory to this list, append it
>>> sys.path.append(′/my/new/path′)

Object Oriented Programming in Python: Defining Classes

Objects
- object.method()

Defining a class
- class is a special kind of data type which defines how you build an object
- Python doesn't use separate class interface, you just define it in the same program then use it
- define a method in a class by including function defintions
    - must be a special first argument 'self' in all method definitions 
    - usually a special method called __init__
- Eg:
class Student:
    ″″″A class representing a student.″″″
    def __init__(self, n, a):
        self.full_name = n
        self.age = a
    def get_age(self):
        return self.age

Creating and Deleting Instances
- there is no "new" keyword in python
    - just use the class name and assign the result to a variable
    - arguments passed this way are given the __init__() method
- eg: b = Student("Bob", 21)
    - __init__() can take any number of arguments, but first argument is special

Deleting instances: No need to "free"
- automatic garbage collection

Access to Attributes and Methods
class Student:
    ″″″A class representing a student.″″″
def __init__(self, n, a):
    self.full_name = n
    self.age = a
def get_age(self):
    return self.age

>>> f = Student (″Bob Smith″, 23)
>>> f.full_name # Access an attribute.
    ″Bob Smith″
>>> f.get_age() # Access a method.
23

Accessing unknown members
- names or methods given at run time
- use getattr(object_instance, string)
    - string contains the name of an attribute or method of a class
    - returns a reference to that attribute or method
    - only needed when writing very extensible code

>>> f = Student(″Bob Smith″, 23)
>>> getattr(f, ″full_name″)
″Bob Smith″

>>> getattr(f, ″get_age″)
    <method get_age of class studentClass at 010B3C2>

>>> getattr(f, ″get_age″)() # We can call this.
23

>>> getattr(f, ″get_birthday″)
# Raises AttributeError – No method exists.

hasatttr(object, string)
>>> f = Student(″Bob Smith″, 23)
>>> hasattr(f, ″full_name″)
True
>>> hasattr(f, ″get_age″)
True
>>> hasattr(f, ″get_birthday″)
False

Two Kinds of Attributes
- Data attributes
    - each instance of the class has it's own value
    - created by an __init__() method
- Class attributes
    - all instances of the class have the same value
    - called static
    - defined within a class
    - accessed using: self.__class__.name
    - eg:
        class Sample:
            x = 23
            def increment(self):
                self.__class__.x += 1
        >>> a = Sample()
        >>> a.increment()
        >>> a.__class__.x
        24

INHERITANCE
Subclasses
- a class can extend the definition of another class
- to define a subclass, put the name of the superclass in parentheses after the subclass's name in the signature
    class AI_Student(Student):
- python has no 'extends' keyword like Java
- Multiple inheritance is supported

Redefining Methods
- to redefine a method from a parent class, include a new definition using the same name 
- the only time you explicity pass 'self' as an argument is when calling a method of an ancestor
    ParentClass.methodName(self,a,b,c)

Definition of a class extending student
class Student:
    ″A class representing a student.″
    def __init__(self, n, a):
        self.full_name = n
        self.age = a
    def get_age(self):
        return self.age
class AI_Student (Student):
    ″A class extending Student.″
    def __init__(self,n,a,s):
        Student.__init__(self,n,a) #Call __init__ for student
        self.section_num = s
    def get_age(self): #Redefines get_age method entirely
    print(″Age: ″ + str(self.age))

Extending __init__
- parentClass.__init__(self, x,y)

Built-In Members of Classes
- all built-in members have double underscores around their names: __init__ __doc__

Redefining the printing string: __repr__()
class Student:
    def __str__(self):
        return "I am %s aged %d" % (self.full_name, self.age)
    def __repr__(self):
        return "Student(%s, %d)" % \
            (repr(self.full_name), repr(self.age))
...
>>> f = Student(″Bob Smith″, 23)
>>> print(f)
I am Bob Smith aged 23
>>> repr(f)
Student("Bob Smith", 23)

Special Methods
- you can redefine these as well
__init__ : The constructor for the class.
__cmp__ : Define how == works for class.
__len__ : Define how len( obj ) works.
__copy__ : Define how to copy a class.
- other built-in methods allow you to give a class the ability to use [] notation like an array or () like a function call

Special Data Items
__doc__ : Variable storing the documentation string for that
class.
__class__ : Variable which gives you a reference to the class
from any instance of it.
__module__ : Variable which gives you a reference to the
module in which the particular class is defined.

Useful:
- dir(x) - returns a list of all methods and attributes

Special Data Items - Example
>>> f = Student(″Bob Smith″, 23)
>>> print f.__doc__
A class representing a student.
>>> f.__class__
< class studentClass at 010B4C6 >
>>> g = f.__class__(″Tom Jones″, 34)

Private Data and Methods
- any attribute or method with two leading underscores is meant to be treated as private!
-
