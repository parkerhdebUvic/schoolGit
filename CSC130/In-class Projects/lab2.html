    <h1>Computer Science Labs at UVic</h1>
	
    <h2>Labs help students grow their skills 
	introductory computer science courses</h2>
		
    <p><sup>1</sup>Simply reading, watching and listening can teach us only so much. 
	Whereas learning by doing is active learning, and very different from 
	learning by passively consuming. We may consume all the information 
	available, but to truly learn a new technology, we must actually use 
	it and put our skills to the test. In the case of learning programming, 
	we must write code.</p>
	
    <p>At the start of each slide set, I post links to good online resources 
	that have exercises you can work through to practice the concepts covered 
	in lecture. Two good resources are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>In CSC 130, the labs are designed to provide you with an opportunity
	to practice important concepts introduced during lecture.</h2>

	<p>Use the worksheets from lecture as a reference when working through
	the lab work.</p>
	<p>The worksheets and lab work will be your main resources for studying
	for the two midterms. The worksheets and lab activities should help you
	with some parts of your term projects as well. </p>
