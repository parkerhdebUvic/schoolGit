How many subjects do you need to run a randomized control trial?
    - Indicate if an intervention had an impact
    
How do we know that two compare groups are different or the same, 
and not due to our selection process?
    - 

Possible outcomes 2x2 (cumulative of both sides, individually, is 1)
![Alt text](image-1.png)
    - Treatments are not different
        - Correct decision
        - Incorrect decision: type 1 error (alpha)
    - Treatments are different
        - Incorrect decision: type 2 error
        - Correct decision

- probability of making type 1 error (also alpha) or P-value,
    is the likelihood of difference being by chance
    - p <.05 indicates the difference between groups does reflect
    any true difference between therapies A and B is only 0.05 (1 in 20)

Power of study
- each side adds up to one
- the correct decision is called "power of the study"

Summary of terms
- alpha | probability of type 1 error; concluding they differ when they do not
- beta | probability of type 2 error; concluding they do not differ when they do
- power | 1 - beta; probability of concluding correctly that treatments differ

Factors to estimate the sample size
- difference in response rates to be detected
- An estimate of the response rate in one of the groups
- level of statistical significance (alpha)
- the value of the power desired (1 - beta)
- whether the test should be one-sided or two-sided (improvement, and or harm)
        - every decision affects the number of people you need!

If they give you the P value, sample size, and confidence intervals, but don't give you the strength of the study, then it's potentially BS!
    - if the margin is too large, dump it

Looking at a Randomized trial article:
A Randomized Outpatient Trial
of a Decision-Support Information Technology Tool
1.  Difference  |   0.05
2.  Baseline    |   0.5
3.  alpha       |   0.05        
4.  1-beta      |   0.8         (power of study)
5.  tails       |   one-tailed  (by not identifying 2 tail)
6.  drop rate   |   not specified
7.  ending sample size |    1425, did not achieve their desired count

We don't know if they kept the number of people they needed

Recuiting and Retention of Study Participants
- Getting enough participants
- randomize them
- cannot convince or coerce people
- the need to have sufficient informaiton to make an informed decision
- need to know compensation and if there are untoward effects
- necessary reparations need to be provided (compensation of paticipants wages / time) if they would lose income by participaiton
- cannot provide cash incentives

Efficiency & Number Needed to Treat (NNT)
- Efficacy = ((placebo rate) - (rate of treatment)) / (placebo rate)
- NNT = 1 / ((rate untreated) - (rate in treated))

![Alt text](image-2.png)

- in RCT paper
    - placebo: stenting 2.9%
    - intevention: endartaectomy 1.7%
        Efficacy = (2.9 - 1.7) / 1.7 = 1.2 / 1.7 = ?
        NNT = 1 / (2.9 - 1.7) = 1 / 1.2 = ?
    - Rate of freedom
        - stenting 97.8
        - enartaectomy 97.3
    - conclusion: there is almost no benefit of choosing stent vs enartaectomy

Internal validity: how the study was conducted
External validity: ability to generalize study findings to all patients with the disease

Clinical implications
- Would my patient improve or not from therapy A?
- Would my patient be in the group that developed side effects?
- Would my patient be in the group that benefited from treatmeny B?

![Clinical implications](image-3.png)
- what group is my patient likely to fall into?

Phases in testing of new drugs ("Phase 1 Study", etc)
- Phase 1   |   20-80 patients
- Phase 2   |   100-200 patients
- Phase 3   |   lage scale RCT
- Phase 4   |   post market surveillance after approved for sale
- Phase 5   |   integration of treament into widespread public health practice

Ethical considerations
- issues around randomization
- use of placebo
- obtain informed consent
- early stoppage of a clinical trial
- publication bias: every RCT is followed live to prevent publication bias

"Solve the 15 questions related to the end of this chapter"


Absolute risk, relative risk, and OR ration

Absolute risk
- magnitidue of risk in a group with a certain exposure
- does not 
- same as attack rate, but for the entire populaiton

Determining the association between a disease and an exposure:
- Ratio: (disease risk in exposes) / (disease risk in nonexposed)
- delta difference: (disease risk in exposed) - (disease risk in non exposed)
- you need to see the absolute risk numbers in order to tell if delta is valid

Absolute risk calculation
- 2x4 matrix
![Alt text](image-4.png)

Efficacy: the benefit in an RCT sample group
Effectiveness: the benefit in the larger population


Relative Risk = (risk in exposed) / (risk in nonexposed)
relative risk = (incidence in exposed) / (incidence in nonexposed) = (a/(a+b)) / (c/(c+d))
- if RR = 1, no association
- if RR > 1, positive assocaition; possibly causal
- if RR < 1, negative assocation; possibly protective


Odds Ratio
- (odds of an event happening) / (odds of an event not happening)
- ad/bc
![Odds Ratio](image-5.png)

- odds ratio is a valid measure of risk when;
    - cases are representative of the populaiton regarding exposure
    - controls are representative of the population regarding exposure
    - the disease occurrence is infrequent

Calculating odds ratio in matched pairs:
![Alt text](image-6.png)

In an unmatched odds calculation, use (ad)/(bc)

Chapter 12 questions:
- 1: 
        - exposed:2872, cancer:24, benign:52
        - not exposed:5055, cancer:0, benign:6

                Diseased 
        e   52      |       2820
        x         a | b
        p   _____________________
        o
        s   6     c | d     5051
        e           |
        d

    (a/(a+b)) = 52/2872 = 0.018
    (c/(c+d)) = 6/5051 = 0.0011

    0.018 / 0.0011 = 16.3

    "16.3 times more likely to develope a benign thyrod tumor"
