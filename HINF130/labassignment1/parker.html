            <p><b>What brought you into the program?</b><br/><br/>
                When I first started at UVic, I had only a 
                vague idea of the direction I wanted to go 
                with my studies! I knew I wanted work populations 
                and technology, but it wasn&apos;t until my second 
                year that I even heard of Health Informatics! 
                HINF offered me the perfect blend of purpose, skillset, 
                and income that I was looking for.<br/><br/><br/></p>
            <p><b>Did you have any prior experience?</b><br/><br/>
                Only a little! I was fortunate to spend a summer with 
                the INSPIRE program at UVic where our team designed 
                software for emergency homeless shelters; it was an 
                absolutely invaluable experience.<br/><br/><br/></p>
            <p><b>What is your current academic background?</b><br/><br/>
                I&apos;m in my 3rd year of the combined Computer Science & 
                Health Informatics program, so most of my courses have focused 
                on math, statistics, programming, computer science, and Canadian 
                health policy!<br/><br/><br/></p>
            <p><b>What would you say are the top 3 most important skills for a health informatitian?</b><br/><br/>
                I can only speak from what I&apos;ve picked up through my classes and heard from graduates working 
                in the industry! Health Informatics is an incredibly broad field, so the top 3 skills for the direction 
                I&apos;m going includes the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>Communication & Empathy</li>
                    <li>Statistics & Research</li>
                    <li>Programming & Design</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
